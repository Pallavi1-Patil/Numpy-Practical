What is Numpy?
Numpy is a scientific computing library for Python.
Support large number of data in the form of multi-dimentional array and matrix.
Use for mathematical calculation like linear algebra, Fourier transform and random numbers etc...

Multidimentional Numpy array
1D Array
array([1 2 3])

2D Array
array([1, 2, 3],
      [1, 2, 3],
      [1, 2, 3])
